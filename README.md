Essentially, backtesting takes historical data and applies it to current data to predict how stocks would perform.<br><br>
The main issue with backtesting is that it is a lot of work and takes a long to do manually, so that is why it would be smart to build one with Python. The strategy we will use is the moving averages strategy and implement that into our code. Let's Begin!"<br><br>
This is introduction to the publication about my code.
